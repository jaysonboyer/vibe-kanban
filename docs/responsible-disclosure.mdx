**Last updated:** *February 28, 2026*

At **Vibe Kanban**, we take the security of our platform and the safety of
our customers' data seriously. We welcome responsible reports of potential
security vulnerabilities to help us identify and resolve issues quickly and
securely.

## How to Report a Security Issue

If you believe you've discovered a vulnerability in Vibe Kanban that falls
within scope, please send an email to:

[**security@bloop.com**](mailto:security@bloop.com)

When submitting a report, include the following where possible:

- **Summary** of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue (screenshots or clear descriptions help)
- **Environment details** (OS, browser, device, etc.)
- **Proof-of-concept code** or any relevant exploit details

Upon receipt of your report, we will:

1. Acknowledge it in a timely manner.
2. Investigate and triage the issue.
3. Communicate with you for clarification or retesting if needed.
4. Work to remediate the issue and keep you updated.

## What's In Scope

The following services and assets are currently in scope for responsible
disclosure:

- https://cloud.vibekanban.com (remote server)
- https://relay.vibekanban.com (relay server)

In most cases, we will only reward the following types of vulnerabilities:
- Arbitrary code execution
- SQL injection

If you are unsure whether something is in scope, please contact us before
testing.

## What's Out of Scope

To ensure everyone's safety and to focus on issues that genuinely affect our
users, the following are considered out of scope:

- Automated scanning without prior coordination
- Social engineering targeting Vibe Kanban personnel
- Rate-limiting or missing headers that do not lead to material harm
- Brute force or denial-of-service attacks
- Attacks requiring physical access to systems or interception of another
  user's network traffic
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without a practical proof of exploitability

## Please Do Not

- Access or modify any data that does not belong to you
- Disrupt our services or cause downtime
- Share details of the issue publicly before we have had a chance to fix it

## Report Format Recommendations

To help us diagnose issues efficiently, reports should include:

- A clear **summary and title** of the issue
- Affected URL(s) or components
- Exact **steps to reproduce**, including screenshots where appropriate
- Environment and version details
- Proof-of-concept code or payloads

## Safe Harbour & Recognition

We respect the efforts of security researchers who act in good faith and follow
this Responsible Disclosure policy. Provided you comply with this policy,
**Vibe Kanban will not pursue legal action** against individuals reporting
vulnerabilities responsibly.

Researchers who submit valid and impactful reports may also receive
**recognition** or other discretionary rewards, at Vibe Kanban's sole
discretion.

## Confidentiality

All information you share with us as part of your report will be handled
confidentially. We will not disclose sensitive details publicly before
remediation, and we will coordinate with you if public acknowledgement is
planned.

## Bounty & Rewards

Vibe Kanban may offer monetary rewards for qualifying vulnerability reports.

For critical, well-documented disclosures that demonstrate clear impact
(such as remote code execution), we may pay up to $5,000 USD per vulnerability.

Rewards are determined at our sole discretion and depend on factors such as:

- Severity and impact of the issue
- Quality and clarity of the report
- Reproducibility
- Whether the vulnerability is previously unknown

Not all reports will qualify for a reward.
