Remote Access allows you to access a host instance of Vibe Kanban from another device, like your mobile phone.

# 1. Launch Vibe Kanban on the host device

Make sure you've started Vibe Kanban and logged in.

# 2. Generate a pairing code

Open the settings dialog, navigate to the `Remote Access` tab and click `Show pairing code`:

# 3. Log into Vibe Kanban cloud

On the client device where you'd now like to access your host machine from, navigate to [cloud.vibekanban.com](https://cloud.vibekanban.com) in a browser and log in.

# 4. Pair your client with your host

On your client, navigate to `Remote Access` and click `Link a host`. Select the relevant host from the dropdown:
